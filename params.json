{"name":"Gmts","tagline":"GMTs Stack Overflow chat room","body":"### These are some basic rules/FAQs for the [GMTs Stack Overflow chat room](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/75819/gmts)\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nThis room was initially created in order to moderate SO [R tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) during the GMT time zones due to inactivity of most of the users during this time of the day and hence, making the moderation harder. Though, in time it evolved into a room where we just make fun of @Cath most of the time.\r\n\r\n## Basic Rules\r\n1. If you have at least 1K reputation, you can request for write access. If you French, then you will need at least 2K reputation. Though exceptions can be made.\r\n\r\n2. Anyone can say pretty much anything in the room as long as it is respectful of others.\r\n\r\n3. Please don't post answers of yours in the chat room in order to collect pity up votes. \r\n\r\n4. Please don't link specific users in the chat room in order to mob down vote them.\r\n\r\n5. Anyone can ask for help, but this is not help ONLY room- Goofing around in between is mandatory.\r\n\r\n## Being a room owner\r\nThis is a community chat room and hence, pretty much anyone can apply for a room owner- under certain conditions:\r\n\r\n1. You *must* follow the **Basic Rules**\r\n\r\n2. You *must* be at least of 3K reputation so you can also participate in moderation of the [R tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)\r\n\r\n3. You *must* participate in room moderation while active in the room, which means\r\n * Gain/deny write access by request. If a user was been denied write access, they must be informed of the reason (by also linking this page) **and** added to the \"Explicit read access\" section so other room owners will know this user has been dealt with.\r\n * Inform other users upon not following the basic rules, and take action if needed.\r\n\r\n4. It's preferable you also participate in the [R tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) moderation when possible.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
